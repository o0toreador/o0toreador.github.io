			<h3>Coconut Curry Broth</h3>
			<br>
			<p>1. Toast the curry paste in a small amount of oil until fragrant.</p>
			<br>
			<p>2. Add the stock and coconut milk, stirring to dissolve the paste. Cook at a steady simmer for about 5 minutes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>3. Season with fish sauce and lime juice, if desired.</p>

			<h3>Egg Noodles</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Egg noodles range from thin and curly to wide and flat, and are sold fresh or dried; all but the very heftiest and heartiest - think lo mein - are suited to noodle soup.</p>
			<br>
			<p>They should be cooked as briefly as possible - no more than a minute if they're fresh, and slightly longer if dried - to preserve that bouncy bite.</p>

			<h3>Pork Tonkatsu</h3>
			<br>
			<p>1. Season pork with salt and pepper. Dust both sides evenly with flour, tapping off excess.</p>
			<br>
			<p>2. Dip the meat in a bowl of beaten egg. (Allow 1 egg for every 2 pork chops.)</p>
			<br>
			<p>3. Coat the meat evenly in panko, pressing down gently to make sure it sticks.</p>
			<br>
			<p>4. Heat a heavy skillet with about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil to 350Â°F. Using kitchen tongs, lay 1 or 2 cutlets in the oil and deep-fry until golden brown (about 7 minutes), turning once or twice. Drain on paper towels and slice before serving.</p>

			<h3>Broccoli</h3>
			<br>
			<p>Blanch florets in well-salted boiling water until broccoli is still firm but can be pierced with a fork (about 3 minutes). Drain and use right away, or toss in any or all of the following: sesame oil, oyster sauce, toasted sesame seeds.</p>
		</li>

			<h3>Sriracha</h3>
			<br>
			<p>This much-loved hot sauce needs no introduction, but it's worth noting that when we use sriracha to add heat to a dish, we are also adding salt, sugar, and acidity. If you've put a lot of thought into seasoning your broth, you might want to consider a more neutral heat agent: chili oil, say, or straight up chopped chilis.</p>
