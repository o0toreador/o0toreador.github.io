			<h3>Spoil</h3>
			<br>
			<p>A 4-player board game about parents spoiling their kids and kids getting spoiled. As a parent, your job is to pave your kidsâ€™ path with as many presents as possible. Of course, you also want them to love you more than your self-absorbed and indulgent partner. As a kid, your job is to act like a spoiled brat, grab all the presents you can, and keep fighting with your brother/sister.
